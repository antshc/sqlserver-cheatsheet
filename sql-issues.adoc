= SQL Query Performance Issues – Master List (Most Common First)

== ✨ SELECT *
Fetching all columns retrieves unnecessary data and prevents use of covering indexes, leading to more I/O.

*Root Cause:*  
Retrieves all columns, increases I/O, and prevents index-only scans.  

*Remediation:*  
Select only needed columns to reduce payload and allow covering indexes.  

== 📦 Insufficient or Poor Indexes
This issue occurs when queries frequently scan entire tables because there are no indexes or the wrong indexes for the workload. Without proper indexing, even simple filters or joins can become very expensive.

*Root Cause:*  
Lack of proper indexes leads to full table scans and slow queries.  

*Remediation:*  
Analyze query patterns and add missing indexes. Use covering indexes where applicable.  

== 📊 Inaccurate or Missing Statistics
The SQL Server query optimizer relies heavily on statistics to estimate row counts and choose efficient plans. Outdated or missing statistics result in poor cardinality estimates and suboptimal execution plans.

*Root Cause:*  
Outdated or missing stats cause poor cardinality estimates and bad plans.  

*Remediation:*  
Update statistics regularly with AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS or scheduled jobs.  

== 🔗 Inefficient Joins
Joins are essential for combining data from multiple tables, but if not implemented properly, they can lead to massive intermediate result sets, excessive memory usage, and network overhead.

*Root Cause:*  
Using implicit join syntax (commas in FROM clause) or incorrect join types causes unnecessary data processing. Poorly defined join conditions lead to Cartesian products, overwhelming memory and tempdb.  

*Remediation:*  
Always use explicit join syntax (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) and define precise join conditions in the ON clause. Choose join types carefully: prefer INNER JOIN when only matching rows are needed, and avoid OUTER JOIN unless required. Ensure indexes exist on join keys to support efficient hash or merge joins.  

== 📅 Scalar Functions in WHERE Clauses
Using functions (e.g., YEAR(), DATEDIFF()) on columns makes them non-SARGable, forcing table scans instead of index seeks.

*Root Cause:*  
Non-SARGable expressions disable index seek and force scans.  

*Remediation:*  
Rewrite queries to avoid functions on indexed columns.  

== 🔄 Implicit Conversions in Joins/Filters
Mismatched data types force SQL Server to perform implicit conversions, disabling index usage.

*Root Cause:*  
Mismatched data types cause scans and prevent index use.  

*Remediation:*  
Align data types in schema and queries to avoid implicit conversions.  

== 🗃️ Improper Data Types
The choice of data types for columns and variables directly impacts how efficiently SQL Server stores and processes data. Using mismatched or overly generic data types increases storage requirements, causes implicit conversions, and reduces index effectiveness.

*Root Cause:*  
Improper data types (e.g., VARCHAR(MAX) for short strings, mismatched types in joins) lead to unnecessary data conversions, potential truncation, and prevent indexes from being fully utilized.  

*Remediation:*  
Choose data types that match the nature and size of your data. Avoid using large or generic types like VARCHAR(MAX) unless necessary. Ensure data types are consistent across tables and queries to prevent implicit conversions and enable index usage.  

== 📚 Index INCLUDE with NVARCHAR(MAX) Columns
Including large columns like NVARCHAR(MAX) in non-clustered indexes bloats index size and slows maintenance.

*Root Cause:*  
Bloating of non-clustered indexes due to large INCLUDE columns.  

*Remediation:*  
Remove large columns from INCLUDE; consider separate lookup strategies.  

== 🔑 Key Lookups Instead of Covering Indexes
When an index doesn’t include all needed columns, SQL Server performs key lookups for each matching row, causing extra reads.

*Root Cause:*  
Extra I/O for retrieving missing columns from clustered index.  

*Remediation:*  
Add missing columns to covering index or INCLUDE clause.  

== 🌀 Suboptimal Subqueries
Subqueries are queries nested inside another query, useful for calculations or filtering. However, when not written optimally, they can significantly degrade performance. Subqueries in the SELECT clause run once per outer row, and correlated subqueries prevent efficient index usage and parallelism.

*Root Cause:*  
Using subqueries, especially correlated ones, can cause repeated execution for each row and block optimizations like index seeks or parallelism.  

*Remediation:*  
Replace subqueries with JOINs, derived tables, or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) where possible. Avoid correlated subqueries unless absolutely necessary.  

== 📊 Excessive Aggregation
Aggregation groups and summarizes data using functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG. While useful for analytics and reporting, excessive or poorly planned aggregation can overwhelm the database, especially on low-cardinality columns.

*Root Cause:*  
Using aggregation functions on low-cardinality columns creates few groups but requires scanning and processing large amounts of data.  

*Remediation:*  
Apply aggregation only on high-cardinality columns relevant to your analysis. Use the HAVING clause to filter groups after aggregation and minimize rows processed. Avoid unnecessary aggregation in subqueries; pre-filter rows using WHERE when possible.  

== 🔁 Non-Set-Based Operations
Using cursors or loops (RBAR – Row-By-Agonizing-Row) processes rows one at a time instead of in bulk. This kills performance on large datasets.

*Root Cause:*  
Row-by-row processing (RBAR) causes poor performance.  

*Remediation:*  
Rewrite cursors and loops as set-based operations.  

== 🗄 Incorrect Database Design
Poor schema design—like missing normalization, no primary keys, or inappropriate data types—results in queries that require excessive joins or scans.

*Root Cause:*  
Normalization or schema design issues lead to inefficient queries.  

*Remediation:*  
Review schema design, apply normalization or denormalization as needed.  

== 📦 Over-Reliance on Scalar UDFs
Scalar user-defined functions execute row-by-row and prevent parallelism, severely hurting performance.

*Root Cause:*  
Scalar UDFs are executed row-by-row and slow down queries.  

*Remediation:*  
Replace scalar UDFs with inline table-valued functions (TVFs).  

== 📊 Outdated Statistics
Without current statistics, SQL Server cannot estimate row counts accurately, leading to bad join and scan decisions.

*Root Cause:*  
Optimizer makes poor cardinality estimates with stale stats.  

*Remediation:*  
Use AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS or manual updates.  

== 🔄 Frequently Updated Columns in Many Indexes
Updating columns that exist in multiple indexes triggers maintenance on each index, locking resources and increasing I/O.

*Root Cause:*  
Updates to indexed columns cause index maintenance overhead and locking.  

*Remediation:*  
Avoid indexing volatile columns; review and minimize unnecessary indexes.  

== 🔥 Frequent Recompilation of Queries
Frequent recompilations from OPTION (RECOMPILE), schema changes, or frequent temp table creation increase CPU load and reduce throughput.

*Root Cause:*  
OPTION (RECOMPILE), schema changes, or temp tables force recompiles.  

*Remediation:*  
Minimize recompilations by using stable query patterns and cached plans.  

== 🌟 Celebrity Tables with Too Many Rows
High-traffic tables (hotspots) with millions of rows suffer from contention and degraded performance under heavy read/write operations.

*Root Cause:*  
Hotspot tables suffer from locking and latch contention.  

*Remediation:*  
Partition or shard large tables; archive old data to reduce contention.  

== 🔒 Excessive Blocking
When transactions hold locks for too long, other sessions are blocked waiting for resources. This leads to slow queries, timeouts, and even deadlocks under high concurrency.

*Root Cause:*  
Long transactions and locking cause blocked processes.  

*Remediation:*  
Break long transactions, use proper isolation levels, and monitor blocking sessions.  

== ⚔️ Deadlocks
Deadlocks happen when two transactions wait on each other’s resources indefinitely. This halts progress and requires one transaction to be killed, causing application errors.

*Root Cause:*  
Competing transactions acquire locks in different orders.  

*Remediation:*  
Use TRY/CATCH with retry logic, ensure consistent access order, and optimize indexing.  

== 🗂 Tempdb Contention from Heavy Spills
Large sorts, hash joins, or intermediate results spill to tempdb, overwhelming it under high concurrency.

*Root Cause:*  
Hash joins, sorts, or large temp tables overwhelm tempdb.  

*Remediation:*  
Optimize queries to reduce spills and configure multiple tempdb files.  

== 📊 Poor Partitioning Strategy
Poorly designed partitioning leads to uneven data distribution and unbalanced query workloads.

*Root Cause:*  
Skewed partitions lead to unbalanced workload.  

*Remediation:*  
Design partitions with even distribution; monitor partition hotspots.  

== 🔥 Triggers with Expensive Logic
Triggers that perform complex logic on every DML operation introduce hidden workload and can block transactions.

*Root Cause:*  
Triggers add hidden workload on DML operations.  

*Remediation:*  
Refactor trigger logic or replace with explicit application logic.  

== 🔗 Missing Foreign Keys
Without foreign keys, the optimizer cannot assume referential integrity, which can lead to poor plans and data inconsistency.

*Root Cause:*  
Leads to inefficient joins and orphan data issues.  

*Remediation:*  
Add foreign keys and create supporting indexes for join columns.  

== 🪜 High Index Fragmentation
Heavily fragmented indexes increase page reads and reduce query performance.  

*Root Cause:*  
Fragmented indexes degrade scan performance.  

*Remediation:*  
Reorganize/rebuild indexes regularly.
