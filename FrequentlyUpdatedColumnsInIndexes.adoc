= Remediations for Frequently Updated Columns in Indexes

== ✅ Remediations

* 🔥 **Avoid indexing volatile columns directly**
** Remove the column from nonclustered index keys and INCLUDE lists.
** Let SQL Server use Key Lookups to fetch it when necessary.

* 📝 **Use a computed column without PERSISTED**
** If the column is derived (e.g., `Age` from `DateOfBirth`), calculate it dynamically.
** Avoid storage/maintenance overhead.

* 🎯 **Replace with filtered indexes**
** Create a partial index only for rows where the volatile column matters (e.g., `Age BETWEEN 18 AND 65`).
** Reduces update impact to a subset of rows.

* 📦 **Denormalize volatile data into a separate table**
** Move frequently changing columns into a dedicated table.
** Keep indexes on the main table lean.

* 🔍 **Reevaluate query patterns**
** If the column isn’t used for filtering or sorting, drop it from indexes.
** Fetch it after narrowing rows using other indexed columns.

* 📊 **Consider indexing a derived or bucketed version**
** Replace `Age` with age groups or ranges to reduce update churn.
** Example: `AgeGroup = CASE WHEN Age < 18 THEN 'Minor' ... END`

* 🛠️ **Optimize memory (if necessary)**
** Ensure enough buffer pool memory to reduce lock contention from index updates.
