= SET STATISTICS IO, TIME ON in SQL Server

These are session-level settings to help analyze query performance by showing **I/O** and **time** statistics in the Messages tab of SSMS.

== ‚úÖ SET STATISTICS IO ON

Enables I/O statistics for queries.

=== üì¶ Example Output
----
Table 'Products'. Scan count 1, logical reads 120, physical reads 5, read-ahead reads 10, lob logical reads 0, lob physical reads 0, lob read-ahead reads 0.
----

=== üìå Key Terms
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term                   | Meaning

| *Scan count*           | Number of times the table/index was accessed.
| *Logical reads*        | Pages read from memory (Buffer Pool).
| *Physical reads*       | Pages read from disk (not in Buffer Pool).
| *Read-ahead reads*     | Pages pre-fetched into memory.
| *LOB reads*            | Reads of Large Objects (e.g., varchar(max)).
|===

== ‚úÖ SET STATISTICS TIME ON

Enables CPU and elapsed time statistics.

=== üì¶ Example Output
----
SQL Server Execution Times:
   CPU time = 156 ms,  elapsed time = 432 ms.
----

=== üìå Key Terms
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term             | Meaning

| *CPU time*       | Total CPU processing time used by the query (ms).
| *Elapsed time*   | Total wall-clock time to execute the query (ms).

== üìù Why Use Them?
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Scenario                      | Usefulness

| Debugging slow queries        | Identify high I/O or CPU cost.
| Tuning indexes                | See if index reduces logical reads.
| Comparing query rewrites      | Check which query version is faster.

== üèÉ How to Use
[source,sql]
----
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;

-- Your query
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductID = 42;

-- Turn off when done
SET STATISTICS IO OFF;
SET STATISTICS TIME OFF;
