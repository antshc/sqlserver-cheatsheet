== SQL Server query analyzer
_Execution Plan_ – A static blueprint showing how SQL Server planned (Estimated Plan) or executed (Actual Plan) your query. Used for analyzing and tuning query performance after execution.

_Live Query Statistics_ – A dynamic, real-time view showing query progress while it’s running, including active operators and percentage completion. Used for monitoring long-running queries.

_What is “Cost” in SQL Query Analyzer?_
The Cost represents the estimated amount of resources (CPU, I/O, memory, etc.) SQL Server thinks it will need to execute that part of the query.

_Operator Cost (Node Relative)_ Inside a single query’s execution plan, each operator (like a Clustered Index Scan, Sort, Hash Join) shows its individual cost as a percentage of the total query cost.
Meaning: “This step accounts for X% of this query’s total estimated cost.”

_Read plan_ -  read the plan from right to left, hovering our mouse over each operator. Each operator is kinda like a standalone program that has its own dedicated work to do, and produces a specific output.

_Estimated Number of Executions_ is based on how many rows SQL Server thought was going to come out of the Index Seek. For each row we found, we’re gonna have to execute one Key Lookup.
_Estimated Number of Rows_ – how many rows EACH key lookup will return.
_Number of Executions_ – how many times we actually did it, based on how many rows actually came out of the index seek.
_Actual Number of Rows_ – the total number of rows that came out of ALL key lookups (not each one.)


_Logical Read_	Reading a data page from buffer cache (memory). Even if SQL Server has to go to disk first.
_Physical Read_	Reading a data page directly from disk into the buffer cache (because it wasn’t there yet).
