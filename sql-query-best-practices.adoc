== 🧠 Easy Recall: Why `SELECT *` is Bad (esp. with `ORDER BY`)

=== 🎯 3 Main Problems (The “BIG” Rule)
* **B** – *Bloated rows*: Fetches all columns, increasing row size, memory, and I/O.
* **I** – *Index ignored*: Prevents use of covering indexes; forces clustered index scan or key lookups.
* **G** – *Greater sort cost*: Sorts full rows (load all columns in memory), needs larger memory grant, may spill to tempdb.

=== 🚦 Execution Plan Comparison
[cols="2,2", options="header"]
|===
| With `SELECT ColA, ColB`
| With `SELECT *`

| ✅ Index Seek/Scan (fast)
| ❌ Clustered Index Scan (slow)

| ✅ No Sort (if index matches)
| ❌ Sort operator added

| ✅ Small memory grant
| ❌ Large memory grant (risk spill)
|===

=== ✅ Best Practice
*“Only ask for what you need.”*

SELECT ColA, ColB
FROM LargeTable
ORDER BY ColA;

=== 🔥 Mnemonic
🏃‍♂️ *“BIG rows IGNORE indexes, GREEDY sort!”*
