| #  | Clause       | Action                                  | Hint

| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | FROM         | Find base tables & load data            | Start from the source
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | JOIN         | Combine tables (apply ON conditions)    | Join rows together
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | WHERE        | Filter rows (before grouping)           | Filter individual rows
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | GROUP BY     | Group rows for aggregation              | Group them up
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | HAVING       | Filter groups (after aggregation)       | Have good groups
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | SELECT       | Pick columns & expressions              | Select what to show
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | DISTINCT     | Remove duplicates                       | Make results unique
| 8Ô∏è‚É£ | ORDER BY     | Sort rows                               | Order your results
| 9Ô∏è‚É£ | LIMIT        | Return a subset (pagination)            | Limit what you see

== üö¶ Why This Order?
- üìù **FROM/JOIN** ‚Üí data is loaded & combined first.
- üî• **WHERE** ‚Üí filters rows **before aggregation**.
- üìä **GROUP BY + HAVING** ‚Üí aggregate & filter groups.
- üéØ **SELECT** ‚Üí only now compute selected columns.
- üì¶ **DISTINCT/ORDER BY/LIMIT** ‚Üí final shaping.

== üèÅ Example Flow

[source,sql]
----
SELECT Dept, COUNT(*) AS Cnt
FROM Employees
JOIN Departments ON DeptId = Id
WHERE Salary > 50000
GROUP BY Dept
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY Cnt DESC
LIMIT 10;

| Step | Action

| 1Ô∏è‚É£   | Get `Employees`, join with `Departments`.
| 2Ô∏è‚É£   | Filter `Salary > 50000`.
| 3Ô∏è‚É£   | Group rows by `Dept`.
| 4Ô∏è‚É£   | Keep groups with more than 3 rows (`HAVING`).
| 5Ô∏è‚É£   | Select `Dept, COUNT(*) AS Cnt`.
| 6Ô∏è‚É£   | Sort by `Cnt DESC`.
| 7Ô∏è‚É£   | Return top 10 rows.
